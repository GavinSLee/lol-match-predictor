# League of Legends Match Predictor

I've been playing League of Legends (LoL) for the last 8 years; also, I took Brown's Machine Learning course (CSCI 1420) my sophomore spring. I decided that it would be a little fun to see if I could combine what I had learned in ML with some game stats that I've accumulated over the years.

Thus, I wanted to answer the question: Given a LoL's game stats at the 15 minute mark, can we determine which side will win? 

## Yours Truly (Leego671)

Here's a look at my current League account, which has the username Leego671. As of 8/24/2020, my account is Silver II for solo/duo ratings; however, I don't really play too much solo queue, as I tend to play with friends in larger parties (3+ more people).

I'm not the best player, and I would say that my rank is fairly indicative of my skill level. In other words, I would say my skill is around high silver/low gold, maybe high gold on a good day.
